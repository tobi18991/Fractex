				<h2>Welcome to Fractex</h2>
				<p>
					This is the ultimate fractal-explorer based on WebGL. You can create fractals in your own browser
					and explore them live on this site. All explorers have the ability to change parameters of a
					fractal, so you can see how different they will look for other options. Also with WebGL all
					explorers are very fast (less than a second rendering time!).
				</p>
				<p>
					Fractex has a nice and simple responsive design so it's possible to use these explorers also on a
					smartphone or tablet. You don't need any extra app for Fractex, because all you need is your
					browser! That's why I tried to make this site as lightweight as possible to give you also the best
					experiences on the go.

				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>
					Fractex was created after a prototype for exploring the Mandelbrot set. Because of a very slow
					rendering time about five to ten seconds with JavaScript, I tried to speed up the rendering process
					for an image. With WebGL and shaders it is now possible to render an image within less a second.
				</p>
				<p>
					But I had a specific reason to make this explorer: In my school, I have a seminar about scientific
					work, where we study a specific subject. Mine is about complex numbers. These numbers are  building
					the base for the Mandelbrot set and so I decided to build an explorer myself to make "my own"
					Mandelbrot fractal. This explorer is now called Fractex.
