# Fractex - The ultimate fractal explorer

Fractex is the best fractal explorer for exploring and studying fractals in your browser. The only thing you need is a
browser with support for WebGL, which almost every current browser does. Afterwards you can start your journey in the
broken dimensions!

Because of WebGL, all explorers are very fast. One image will be rendered in less than a second, so you can easily move
around in the fractal! Additionally, you can change some parameters of every fractal to see the differences between some
options. The perfect way for studying fractals!

## Current explorers

These are all the explorers that are currently on Fractex:

* Mandelbrot
* Julia-Fractal

*More explorers will come soon...*

## Advantages

1. **Lightweight design**: around 170KB at the first visit and around 400B for every site afterwards
2. **Responsive design**: can be viewed on every smartphone and tablet out on the market, which supports WebGL
3. **WebGL**: fast rendering in less than a second!
